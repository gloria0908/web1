 <strong> love yourself<br> love myself<br> peace</strong>
 <p>So let's take all one more step.
We have learned to love ourselves, so now I urge you to speak yourself.
I'd like to ask all of you, What is your name? What excites you and makes your heart beat?
Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction.
No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, your gender identity, just speak yourself.
Find your name and find your voice by speaking yourself.</p><img src="stage.jpg"width="100%">
 <p style="margin-top:45px;">I'm Kim Nam-joon, and also RM of
<a href="http://bts.ibighit.com/" target="_blank" title="BTS site">BTS</a>.
I am an idol, and I am an artist from a small town in Korea.
Like most people, I've made many and plenty mistakes in my life.
I have many faults, and I have many more fears,
but I'm going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I'm starting to love myself gradually, just little by little.
What is your name? Speak yourself.</p>
